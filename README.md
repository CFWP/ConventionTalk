This repository contains the slides of my Division 5 (Quantitative & Qualitative Methods) Awards Symposium Invited address at the American Psychological Association 2015 Annual Convention in Toronto. These slides support a summary of my dissertation work to be published in The Score (see reference below).

## A Terse Explanation to the Slides
The slides were used to shortly present my dissertation research.
This dissertation (Peeters, 2012) received the 2015 Anne Anastasi Distinguished Dissertation Award

1. Titlepage
2. The shortest possible summary of the dissertation: Its a layer-cake (also see Slide 8). 
3. The dissertation considers the factor model, which comes in two general flavors: Eploratory and Confirmatory.
MORE EXPLANATION (short statement differences EFA and CFA)
4. Explain slide 4 (contribution to EFA: dimensionality selection; shows what happens when fitting a 5-factor model to data generated under 3 latent factors. Space rips apart. Have Bayesian approach that copes with this.)
5. Explain slide 5 (traditional specification CFA)
6. Explain slide 6 (explain shortly how Bayes factor works for this situation.)
7. Explain slide 7 (What does it allow: directly compare a multitude of competing inequality-constrained structures. Example of two here)
8. Explain slide 8 (Back to the cake: The layers are formed by.... Top layer > applications)
9. Explain slide 9 (One application considers MBS)
10. Explain slide 10 (Another application considers Chimpanzee handedness)
11. Acknowledgements: Supervisors.
12. Acknowledgements: People who provided data for the applications in the dissertation.
13. Acknowledgements: Wife and collaborator (not necessarily in that order).
